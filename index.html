<p> <b>B</b>ritain could send tens of  of asylum seekers to the East African country of Rwanda, <u>Prime Minister</u> Boris Johnson said on Thursday, aiming to break people <br> <br>-smuggling networks and stem the flow of migrants across the Channel.

But his plan drew swift criticism from <mark>opponents</mark> of his Conservative Party and from charities.
